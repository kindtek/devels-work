# Idle Hands are the **Developer's Workshop**

## Import a Linux Docker image from the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=&image_filter=official) into WSL _virtually_ without lifting a finger

---

## SETUP

### Easy as 1, 2, .., 4

1. Copy/pasta a line of code below into a terminal ([CMD or Powershell](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-Terminal-in-Windows))
2. Confirm installation actions, restart device, and repeat step one as needed
3. ??
4. WSL, PYTHON, DOCKER-IN-DOCKER, KERNEL, GUI, KALI, CUDA, ...

```bat
powershell.exe -Command "Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kindtek/powerhell/dvl-works/devel-spawn.ps1 -OutFile dvlp.ps1;powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -File env:USERPROFILE/dvlp.ps1 kali-gui-kernel"


```

## With little more than a few key strokes and restarts, a suite of essential developer productivity software will be pushed to your Windows 10+ machine.

### Set up occurs so smoothly that you will likely feel like you skipped step 3 -- especially if you've been tripped up by any of these tricky procedures _(ie : installing WSL, Github, Docker, seting up SSH logins with Github and Docker, manually adding new app registries, building a kernel, installing a GUI on Linux)_ in the past. But don't worry, as long as you keep repeating step 1, have a reliable internet connection, and a handful of gigabytes to spare of hard drive space there is no technical expertise required. You can use some of the time you're saving during the installation process to make an informed choice between the two options you will have once installation is complete. You can either try out your fresh WSL install and use Kali Linux to go straight to `/hel` in a [sandboxed user environment](https://github.com/kindtek/devels-playground#line-dance-with-the-devel) or use the devel's playground to try out any of the thousands of Docker Linux images on the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=&image_filter=official) into your fresh WSL install. There's no wrong choice. Check out this summary of user environments [images offered by Kindtek](https://github.com/kindtek/devels-playground#image-tags) that you can set as your main WSL environment with the devels-playground

## At the end of the installation sequence, your WSL environment will be pushed a ~250MB [image](https://github.com/kindtek/devels-playground#ubuntu-dind) and the capability to contribute to this repository using either Github or Docker immediately. It is one simple `git clone` away from using with any other repo on Github.

### This tool will remove the need to scour the internet for how-to guides so you can spend your weekend actually tackling your project instead of wrestling with setting up your machine. The devels-workshop comes with all the tools to configure your system from the GUI right down to the kernel with all of the technical labor eliminated at the lowest level. Fork this repo and see how easy it is to set up your own developer environment that revolves around a github repo.. all by pasting one line of code

### The Docker Linux images [created by Kindtek](https://github.com/kindtek/devels-playground#image-tags) and hosted by [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/kindtek/dvlp) on the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=&image_filter=official) are available for free.
